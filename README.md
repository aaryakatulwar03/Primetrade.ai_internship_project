## Methodology

1. **Data Cleaning:** Standardized column names, converted timestamps to datetime, and filtered valid accounts.  
2. **Feature Engineering:** Created `is_win`, `trade_return`, `side_encoded`, and `notional`.  
3. **Data Merging:** Joined trading data with sentiment by date.  
4. **Exploratory Analysis:**  
   - Win rate by sentiment  
   - Daily total closed PnL by sentiment  
   - Statistical tests (T-test, Mann‚ÄìWhitney U, Cohen‚Äôs d)  
5. **Insights Generation:** Identified performance patterns and statistical significance.

## Key Findings

- Win rate is higher during Greed periods than Fear (0.446 vs 0.415).  
- Statistical significance:  
  - T-test p-value = 9.42 √ó 10‚Åª‚Å∑  
  - Mann‚ÄìWhitney p-value = 3.53 √ó 10‚Åª¬≥‚Å¥  
- Effect size (Cohen‚Äôs d) = 0.029 ‚Üí small but meaningful.  
- Visualizations:  
  - **Figure 1:** Daily total PnL by sentiment  
  - **Figure 2:** Win rate by sentiment

## Notes

- Analysis focuses on descriptive statistics and patterns rather than predictive modeling.  
- Charts and aggregates are generated with Python (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn).  
- Sentiment is analyzed on a daily basis, not intraday.
